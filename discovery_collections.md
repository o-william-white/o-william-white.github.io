As part of the KrillGuard project, we are digitising the Natural History Museum spirit collections from the Discovery Expeditions. 

You can find the latest collection data [here](https://github.com/o-william-white/o-william-white.github.io/tree/main/data).  

See [interactive map](https://o-william-white.github.io/data/expeditions_map.html).
