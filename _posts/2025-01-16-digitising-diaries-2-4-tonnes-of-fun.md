We know that whales eat a lot, judging by their (not exactly easy-to-comprehend) size. But do we really know how much is a lot?


Krill arenâ€™t as tiny as many people believe, as Stephen Nicol highlights in his book The Curious Life of Krill (apparently, he even has a slightly overgrown krill tattooed on his arm to combat misconceptions in daily interactions â€“ I'm yet to be that dedicated to the subject). However, compared to whales, krill are tiny. If we were krill, a blue whale would be twice the length of the Brooklyn Bridge. So how does something that big survive by feeding primarily on something this small? And just how much krill do whales actually eat?


 original monograph on krill by J. Marr (published in 1962), summarising the krill-related findings of the Discovery expeditions, includes a paragraph which modestly states:

"Stomach of a small 72-foot male blue whale, cut open to show the enormous quantity of krill that can be swallowed, even by a young animal <...> there may be between 1 and 2 tons of krill present."

But what does modern science say?

A 2021 study published in Nature by Matthew Savoca and colleagues used a combination of short-duration and multi-day tags, underwater video footage, and drones to determine the feeding rate of baleen whales (see attached figure from their paper outlining the study design). They tracked lunges â€“ feeding events â€“ of individual whales, identified prey types using video and echosounder data, and ultimately calculated species-specific prey consumption estimates.

And the numbers are in...

A typical Antarctic blue whale is thought to consume at least 4.2 tonnes of Antarctic krill per day â€“ and thatâ€™s the most conservative estimate. Thatâ€™s like eating 30,000 cans of tuna in a single day!

But hereâ€™s the most surprising number â€“ the study revealed that before whaling wiped out over 90% of whales in the Southern Ocean, they were consuming around 430 million tonnes of Antarctic krill per year. Thatâ€™s twice the current estimate of total krill biomass! This really put into perspective what massive effects whaling has had on our oceans.


On that slightly grim note, I'll get back cataloguing a tiny fraction of the world's biggest all-you-can-eat buffet. 


Until next time,

P.S. Apparently, the speed at which a whale lunges is more than five times higher than the maximum speed a krill can reach. Add in the suction force from the whaleâ€™s mouth opening, and... well, you're doomed. If youâ€™re krill. Which, luckily, Iâ€™m not.
