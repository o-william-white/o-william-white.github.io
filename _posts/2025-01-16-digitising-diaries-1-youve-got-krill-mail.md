Alexandra here â€” Assistant Curator for KRILLGUARD at the Natural History Museum!

It's been just over a month of me diving into the Natural
History Museum's vast krill collection, and I feel like we're forming a bond.
While these guys may not be the most charismatic creatures (though one could
argue otherwise â€” just look into those eyes...), krill definitely holds at least
some cultural significance. And I don't just mean Bill and Will from Happy
Feet 2. As a major food source for whales, krill's importance has been
recognised for a very long time. The Discovery Investigations, which sourced
much of the collection I'm working with, began collecting krill samples as early
as 1925.   

And if something is significant for local and global economies, where
does it often turn up? On postage stamps! There are some great examples from all
over the world, but my favourite ones are probably the joint issue from 1990
celebrating the cooperation between the USSR and Australia in Antarctica.

But I digress. Krill collection digitisation is going well, and there are plenty
more secrets to uncover. Keep your eyes peeled for updates â€” I'm coming across a
lot of intriguing samples, whether you're a krill specialist or just enjoy a
good historical natural collection gem.

Until next time,

Alexandra
